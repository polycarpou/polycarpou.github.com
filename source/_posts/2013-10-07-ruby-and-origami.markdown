Welcome to my first Octopress Blog post. As a matter of fact welcome to my first actual blog post period. My name is Michael Polycarpou and I am now in the third week at the flatiron school in new york city.

In this post I will be discussing a presentation that I saw which really inspired me in a number of ways and really gives a good idea of the things I like most about the Ruby programming language. This post is more of a motivational article. I promise hardcore coding posts will follow when I am more comfortable with Octopress.

The presentation I saw was from Matthew "Goose" Mongeau and the presentation title he gave was called The Origamist's Ruby. 

The presentation has quite a few quotes scattered around. The first is from _why whos said "Not all code needs to be a factory, some of it can just be origami." Which begins the presentation. 

Goose expresses the point that both origami and programming are a type of art. They both are beautiful, creative and expressive. 
This is a completely new programming paradigm for me. I come from an electrical engineering background where we did a lot of programming in C for microcontrollers. I also did a lot of work on Assembly and worked two summers in a CPU design company where I did spent my time working on Hardware Description Languages. I will tell you something. Programming as I knew it was extremely unexpressive. Even though I had spent years working as a C programmer, I had not seen the creative aspect to it and it requires a long stretch of the imagination to say that it is pretty. Then I learned Ruby. 

Our beloved instructor Avi Flombaum has always said that he loves Ruby so much because it is a language created for the programmer and not for the computer. It is designed so that we can spend less time disecting our ideas into a language a machine can understand and instead spend more time thinking about new and more creative solutions to problems people face.
